## About Checo
**Sergio Perez** – often referred to by his nickname Checo – made his F1 debut for _Sauber_ in 2011 and before the end of his second season he’d signed to drive for _McLaren_. However that proved to be a short-lived relationship. <br>
Perez started karting in 1996. In 2004, with the support of prominent Mexican businessman Carlos Slim’s Escuderia Telmex, he began racing in the Skip Barber series in the USA. <br>
